  <h2>Native American Cultures: The Great Plains</h2>
  <p style="text-align: center"><strong>By Encyclopaedia Britannica, adapted by Newsela staff on 06.15.17</strong></p>

  <div class="gd-image"><iframe src="https://drive.google.com/file/d/17a_5wqCuZx0tFy7jcDKez7gnFkKcaZv2/preview" class="center" allow="autoplay"></iframe></div>

  <p><span class="number-circle">1</span> Plains Native Americans once lived all across the Great Plains. The Great Plains is a huge grassland  at the center of North America. It stretches all the way from Canada to Texas.</p>
  <p><strong>Many Nations and Languages</strong></p>
  
  <div class="gd-image-2"><iframe src="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xq7r08Hl8eM9mMD-EiKGKKHf8P7LuoyC/preview" style="float: right;"></iframe></div>
  
  <p><span class="number-circle">2</span> The Plains Native Americans were not one nation. There were many different people who spoke different languages. The best known of these people include the Blackfoot, Arapaho, Cheyenne, Comanche, Crow, Kiowa, Lakota and Plains Cree.</p>
  <p><span class="number-circle">3</span> Some of their languages are similar to languages spoken as far north as Alaska. Others, such as the Comache, spoke languages from the Uto-Aztecan language family. These are some of the oldest languages in the Americas.</p>
  <p><span class="number-circle">4</span> Plains peoples invented a type of sign language as well. It represented common objects and ideas like "buffalo" or "exchange." This allowed people who spoke different languages to communicate with each other.</p>
  <p><strong>Horses Change Way of Life</strong></p>
  <p><span class="number-circle">5</span> Before 1700, most Plains peoples lived in villages. Some of these villages had populations of several thousand people. Most of their food came from farming.</p>
  <p><span class="number-circle">6</span> However, life changed once horses reached the Great Plains. Horses were brought to North America by the Spanish.</p>
  <p><span class="number-circle">7</span> Many people gave up farming once they had horses. They turned to hunting instead. They also took on a nomadic, or wandering way of life. They left village life behind and spent most of the year following herds of buffalo.</p>
  <p><strong>Family Life: Jobs</strong></p>
  <p><span class="number-circle">8</span> Plains men and women had different jobs. Women gathered plant food, cleaned, cooked and made clothing. Men hunted and made weapons. They also protected the community.</p>
  <p><strong>Food: Buffalo</strong></p>
  <p><span class="number-circle">9</span> Hunting Buffalo meat was the main food of the Plains peoples. At first most buffalo hunters used bows and arrows. Later they used guns. They were able to get guns by trading with Europeans. After the hunt, the women skinned the buffalo and cut up the meat. Most of the meat was cut into thin strips and dried. Once it was dried, it lasted for a long time.</p>
  <p><strong>Dwellings: From Lodges To Tepees</strong></p>
  
   <div class="gd-image-3"><iframe src="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1T6enhYYrH4buMFrs33S12s5cbtyLYOBQ/preview" style="float: right;"></iframe></div>
  
  <p><span class="number-circle">10</span> Before they had horses, people lived in villages. The villages were along rivers. Some villages had populations of up to a few thousand people. Typical village people planted crops in the spring, spent the summer as nomadic hunters, and returned to their villages in the autumn for the harvest.</p>
  <p><span class="number-circle">11</span> Dwellings in the villages were mostly dome-shaped earth lodges. These were roofed and walled with earth and entered through a covered passage. Many Plains people gave up permanent villages after they got horses. They became more reliant on hunting bison by horseback. As a result, they adjusted their way of life to match the habits of the animals.</p>
  <p><span class="number-circle">12</span> Plains people lived in tents called tepees. These were shaped like a cone. Tepees were made by stretching sewn buffalo skins over wooden poles. They could be taken apart quickly and easily. Usually, they were large enough to house an entire family.</p>
  <p><strong>Clothing: Animal Hides, Beads, Feathers</strong></p>
  <p><span class="number-circle">13</span> Plains women made clothes out of animal hides. They decorated them with porcupine quills and beads. Men wore a shirt, leggings and moccasins. In cold weather they wore buffalo-skin robes. These were painted with scenes of battles they had fought. Warriors sometimes wore warbonnets, or headdresses made with eagle feathers. Women wore a long dress, leggings and moccasins.</p>
    <p><strong>Making Tools and Weapons</strong></p>
  <p><span class="number-circle">14</span> Plains people used different parts of the buffalo to make all kinds of items. Bedding and bags were made from buffalo hides. The horns were carved into spoons. The hooves were cooked to make glue.</p>
  <p><span class="number-circle">15</span> Bows for hunting were made out of wood. Arrows were first made with a sharp stone head. Later on, they were made with metal points. Feathers were tied to the end of the arrow to make it fly straight.</p>
  <p><strong>Warfare: Small Raids</strong></p>
  <p><span class="number-circle">16</span> Warfare was common among Plains nations. Fighting rarely involved large forces, though. Usually it was carried out by small raiding parties. Raids were staged for different reasons. Sometimes one nation wanted to punish another for killing one of its members. Other times the purpose was to steal horses.Warriors did not always kill each other. They were honored more for touching an enemy in battle. Brave warriors won the right to wear eagle feathers. These were worn as part of a headdress.</p>
  <p><strong>Today: Reconnecting With The Past</strong></p>
  <p><span class="number-circle">16</span> Over time Plains people lost much of their traditional way of life. Today, many Plains people are trying to reconnect with their past. For example, tribal schools now teach tribal languages. Many of these languages were almost completely forgotten.</p>
